        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m am a digital enthusiast and I am interested in developing a deeper understanding of our digital economy and its effects and potential for our communities and world.  I have owned and maintained my own website since 2004.  In 2012 I began digging deeper into tech (outside of music tech) and I've worked to self-educate for the past several years.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional musician for over 20 years. I've performed as a bassist, violinist, and guitarist primarily in the Destin, Florida area.  Although I gave some lessons previously, in 2007 I started teaching music in earnest.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>General Technology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to get comfortable with web design and building great websites.  I would like to be fluent in multiple technologies and gain the skills needed to learn new technologies efficiently.  I am hoping to pursue a Computer Science degree at Georgia State University and some Tech Degrees from Treehouse so I can get deeper faster with some direction and community support.</p>
