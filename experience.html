        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Since 1993 I have been playing music for a living.  I played violin throughout my childhood ane trained with Classical Sympohony musicians in Birmingham, AL, Boston, MA, and Cleveland, OH as a violinist.  In high school I began teaching myself bass guitar and acoustic guitar.  After graduating college in 1992 I got an oppportunity to help form a band and move to Destin, Florida to perform in a restaurant 5 nights a week. </p>
        <p>After several years of hard work on my guitar and singing skills, I began performing as a solo guitar player in a singer-songwriter format.  In 2005 I co-founded a band called "Beach Mice" with a friend and business partner.  In "Beach Mice" I performed on guitar and electric violin.  We had several good years where we played on the beach several days a week in the Spring and Summer seasons and worked in the Jimmy Buffett owned clubs/restaurants called "Margaritaville."</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Becoming a professional musician blurred the lines between music as a hobby and music as a job.  Although I still love playing and music in general, performing for a living has changed my relationship with music significantly.  For my hobbies I enjoy cycling, cooking, and traveling.</p>
        
        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>For the past 3 years I have enjoyed voluteering weekly to teach a guitar class at a local Senior Center</p>
